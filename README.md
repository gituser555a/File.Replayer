"**Data Delete API**\n\n**Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.\n<br>\n\nThis API allows the caller to delete a previously uploaded data content.<br>    \nYou can use this API in a scenario like removing geofences previously uploaded using the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadpreview) for use in our [Azure Maps Geofencing Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial). You can also use this API to delete old/unused uploaded content and create space for new content.\n\n\n### Submit Delete Request\n\nTo delete your content you will issue a `DELETE` request where the path will contain the `udid` of the data to delete.<br>    \nFor example, to delete a collection of geofences previously uploaded using the Upload API, set the `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received previously in the upload API response. \n\n\n### Delete Data Response\n\nThe Data Delete API returns a HTTP `204 No Content` response with an empty body, if the data resource was deleted successfully.<br>    \nA HTTP `400 Bad Request` error response will be returned if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is not found.
